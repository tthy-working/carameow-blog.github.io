<h1>A Love Letter from Seoul</h1>
<article class="article">Our trip to Seoul felt like stepping into a memory I didn’t know I had. Everything was calm and bright at the same time, the kind of trip that makes you forget what day it is.

We started at Jeonju Hanok Village, where every corner looked like a painting. The roofs curved like waves, the air smelled like roasted chestnuts, and everyone moved slower there. We wore hanbok and took silly photos under golden trees. Lunch was bibimbap in Insadong, warm rice and vegetables mixing with spicy gochujang, simple but perfect.

At Seoul Grand Park, we rode the sky lift across the lake. The city faded behind us, replaced by trees and quiet. We watched red pandas, elephants, and clouds that looked like soft cotton. Then we found a bench by the water, opened our snacks, and stayed there a little longer than we planned.

The next day was all fun at Lotte World. The carousel sparkled, the music never stopped, and we ran from one ride to another like kids who didn’t know how to get tired. My favorite part was the indoor theme park lights reflecting on the ice rink, turning everything into a soft pastel dream.

When we came back to the city, Myeongdong woke us up again with bright signs, K-beauty shops, and the smell of tteokbokki and grilled lobster in the air. We wandered with no real plan, just following the sound of music and the sparkle of street food carts.

Dinner in Mapo was smoky and loud in the best way. Korean BBQ that made us all go quiet for a while, just laughter, sizzling sounds, and the soft clink of chopsticks.

On our last night, we grabbed gimbap and tteokbokki and sat by the Han River. The wind was cold, the city lights were soft, and it felt like time paused for a bit.

We stayed near Myeongdong Station, close to everything but still cozy enough to feel like home. Seoul was loud and gentle, busy and peaceful, all at once. It’s the kind of city that hugs you quietly when you leave.</article>
