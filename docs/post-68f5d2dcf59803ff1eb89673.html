<h1>Sweet Egg Tarts, Soft Goodbyes</h1>
<article class="article">Hong Kong was my last stop before everything changed - before college, before packing up my life for something new. It felt like a short dream sandwiched between two worlds.

The city hit me with energy the moment I landed. Neon lights, honking taxis, the smell of roasted duck and egg waffles floating through the air. It was chaos, but the kind that made me smile. Every corner looked alive, every street had something sizzling.

I started my days with pineapple buns stuffed with butter, the kind that melts before you even bite. Lunch was dim sum heaven: shrimp dumplings, siu mai, and rice rolls so soft they slipped off my chopsticks. In Mong Kok, I found fish balls on skewers, still steaming, coated in spicy curry sauce. In Causeway Bay, I queued forever for roasted goose, crispy and golden, totally worth it. And of course, warm, flaky, sweet egg tarts - I had too many and still not enough.

One night, I tried clay pot rice in a little shop where locals chatted louder than the sizzling pans. The smell of soy sauce and charred rice filled the air. It tasted like comfort, like home. Even the milk tea felt special, strong and creamy, the kind that somehow keeps you awake and calm at the same time.

Between meals, I rode the Peak Tram for the skyline view, wandered through Temple Street Night Market, and took the Star Ferry across Victoria Harbour just to feel the wind. The city felt endless, yet so easy to love.

When it was time to go, I sat by the window with one last egg tart in hand, watching Hong Kong fade beneath the clouds. It wasnâ€™t just goodbye to the city, it was goodbye to a chapter of me that still belonged there, somewhere between the steam of dim sum and the sparkle of the harbor lights.</article>
