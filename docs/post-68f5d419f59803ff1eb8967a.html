<h1>Vending Machines, Ramen, and Midnight Strolls</h1>
<article class="article">Japan feels like a dream that never really wakes up - quiet but alive, sparkling with neon signs and soft vending machine hums. Everywhere I went, there were gachapon machines lined up like little treasure boxes, each one holding something cute, funny, or just plain weird. I always ended up with handfuls of toys and trinkets, and somehow they all made me smile.

Tokyo, Kyoto, Osaka, each city had its own personality. I loved Tokyo’s energy, fast and full of surprises. Kyoto felt like stepping into a painting, with temples, kimonos, and slow rivers. And Osaka? It was laughter, food, and friendly chaos. I think that’s where I felt most at home.

Most nights, I found myself wandering into Don Quijote. That place is a maze of everything — snacks, beauty products, plushies, souvenirs, and the strangest inventions. I’d spend hours exploring the aisles, then step out past midnight with my bag full of random finds. The streets would be quieter by then, but not asleep. I’d walk until I found a glowing ramen shop sign, usually Ichiran, and sit down for my favorite kind of midnight feast. Just me, the sound of soft chatter, and the perfect slurp of ramen.

The food in Japan is another love story. Sukiyaki so tender it melts away, steaming bowls of ramen that taste like comfort, and convenience store meals that somehow feel gourmet at 2 a.m. Every bite made me happy, even the smallest things, like rice balls and matcha snacks from vending machines.

Then came Hakone, a peaceful pause in the middle of it all. The onsen was warm, the air cool, and the mountains wrapped everything in silence. Sitting there, surrounded by mist, I felt calm in a way I hadn’t in a long time.

Japan was everything I love: bright, busy, soft, and full of tiny moments that linger. Maybe that’s why I keep thinking about it - the late night walks, the gacha toys, the ramen slurps. All small things, but together, they felt like magic.</article>
