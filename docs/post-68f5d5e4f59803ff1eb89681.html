<h1>Boba Stars in My Pocket</h1>
<article class="article">Taiwan sparkles in little ways , the buzz of scooters, the glow of night markets, the smell of fried squid and sweet milk tea floating through the air. My days were loud, colorful, and a little sticky from holding too many cups of boba.

Shilin and Ximending were my favorite playgrounds. The night markets there felt endless, stalls sizzling with skewers, crispy chicken cutlets bigger than my face, and that infamous smelly tofu that somehow smelled terrible but tasted amazing. I walked through the crowd with my hands full, one hand holding food, the other clutching another drink.

Speaking of drinks, I basically went on a boba pilgrimage. I tried 50 Lan, TP Tea, Gong Cha, Xing Fu Tang, Ten Ren… each one sweet in its own way. But nothing beat Chun Shui Tang, the original boba shop in Taichung. Their milk tea was rich and creamy, and their dim sum, especially the shrimp dumplings, was the perfect pairing. I still think about it sometimes, like a dream I can taste.

Beyond the food, Taiwan was full of soft, beautiful scenes. I rode the train to Jiufen, where the lanterns glowed like floating stars. I tossed a wish into the sky at Shifen, wandered through the Cat Village surrounded by sleepy cats, and looked up at Taipei 101 towering over the city like a giant watchful friend. The Chiang Kai-shek Memorial Hall felt quiet and grand, like a little reminder of history in the middle of all the color.

Every day ended the same way with another cup of boba in hand, sitting on a bench somewhere, watching the city lights blink. I guess that’s why it felt so special. Taiwan didn’t just give me memories. It gave me pockets full of tiny stars like sweet, soft, and full of bubbles.</article>
