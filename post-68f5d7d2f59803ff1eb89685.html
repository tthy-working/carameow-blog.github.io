<h1>A Pocketful of Sheng Jian Bao</h1>
<article class="article">Shanghai felt like walking through the future while holding hands with the past. Glass towers touched the clouds, but just around the corner, old stone lanes whispered stories in Shanghainese. It’s a city that glows, not just from the lights, but from the life pulsing inside it.

The Bund was magical at night, the skyline sparkling on one side, old colonial buildings glowing softly on the other. I wandered along the river, letting the breeze carry the smell of street food and the hum of the city. Nanjing Road was alive — packed with shoppers, neon lights, and that irresistible roasted chestnut scent. I couldn’t resist stopping at every store and popping into cafés along the way.

Food was one of the best parts. Xiao long bao melted in my mouth, rich with broth. Sheng jian bao were crispy and juicy, perfect for nibbling on the go. I tried Shanghai’s famous crab roe noodles, creamy and flavorful, every slurp a little moment of happiness. Sweet and savory treats, noodles, dumplings, and milk tea, the city never ran out of options.

Disneyland was a dream. The lights, the parades, the castles, it felt like stepping into a storybook. I laughed too much on rides, wandered through Main Street, and even the small snacks felt magical.

I also explored Tianzifang’s cozy alleys filled with art shops, local cafés, and hidden corners that felt like tiny secrets. Yu Garden and the surrounding bazaar gave me a glimpse of old Shanghai - lanterns glowing, koi swimming in ponds, and intricate wooden carvings everywhere. People’s Square, the Shanghai Museum, and the historic streets around Jing’an Temple offered quiet breaks from the city buzz.

Every night ended differently. Sometimes I grabbed sheng jian bao from a street stall and walked along Nanjing Road under neon lights, sometimes I sipped a simple bowl of crab roe noodles in a tiny local eatery, and sometimes I just wandered the Bund, watching the skyline shimmer on the river. Shanghai is bright, chaotic, and kind all at once - a city that lets you taste, see, and feel everything in small, unforgettable moments.</article>
