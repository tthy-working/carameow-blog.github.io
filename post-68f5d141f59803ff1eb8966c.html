<h1>Snow Flakes in My Suitcase</h1>
<article class="article">It still feels unreal - my first solo trip, and it began with snow. I called it “Snow Flakes in My Suitcase” because somehow, I wanted to keep a little piece of Scandinavia with me, even after coming home.

The plane landed in Malmö, and the sky looked like it had been painted with milk and silver. My aunt picked me up at the airport with a warm hug and a thicker jacket. That first night, I slept in her cozy house, jet lagged but happy, listening to the quiet sound of snow brushing against the window.

The next morning, I crossed the bridge to Copenhagen. Two days in the city felt like walking through a fairytale with pastel houses, bicycles everywhere, and cinnamon in the air. I tried Danish pastries so sweet they melted in my hands, took too many photos at Nyhavn, and got lost on purpose in the tiny streets. The cold followed me, but it felt friendly somehow.

Then came my favorite part, flying from Malmö to Stockholm with my sister. Seeing her waiting at the airport made everything warmer, even the minus temperatures outside. We stayed for four days, visiting museums, ice-skating, and chasing sunsets that turned the whole city golden for a few minutes before disappearing again. Every night, we’d share stories over hot chocolate, talking about everything and nothing at once.

From Stockholm, we took a quiet train ride to Oslo. The snow there fell slower, softer. We spent two days wandering through the streets, wrapped in scarves and laughter, drinking coffee that steamed against the cold. Everything felt still, like time was taking a nap.

After Oslo, we returned to Stockholm for a few more days before my flight home. The suitcase I brought felt heavier, not from clothes or souvenirs, but from moments I didn’t want to let go of.

When the plane lifted off, I looked out the window and saw the white rooftops fading below. I smiled, thinking of the snowflakes I’d packed away in my heart - small, fleeting, but enough to remember.</article>
